File structures are whacked
I'm using python 3.3.something
On a Linux distro
FROM NOW ON IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE
    rosa(problem number).py
    rosa(problem number)dat.txt [this is going to be input]
    ANS.txt [this is the file that contains the answer, will be changed each time you run the program]
